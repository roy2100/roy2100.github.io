# Why?

Most people think investing is the part-time job.They can do well with spare time. But is it true? According to data, more retail investors are losing money, only 5 percent of people continue to gain profit.So in my opinion, investing is a hard job, and if you want to win the game in a large time frame, you should spend your most time in it.

# What?

Full time investor should work like warren buffet, spend most of personal time into research.Investor is not like so called "trader", you should not buy&sell stocks/options everyday.
Investing is like expressing opinion but with own money, at the end of the day, there will be clear result either winning or losing.
Before you going into investing, you should learn to be responsible to your own decision, which meaning you should make your own investing decisions, there will no one to help you in this category.At the beginning, most people will be afraid of losing money by making decisions, so they will listen to influencer. But this is not investing, you should believe something from bottom of your heart.

# How?

Being full time investor just like training an AI model for investing decisions, but instead using computer for training/inference, we use our own mind.
Most of your time should be spent on reading new information, but instead of letting algorithm decide what to read, you should proactively choose information source, then make your own decision, and wait for result.
At this moment, time is your friend.

# End

It's both difficult and easy to became full time investor.Enjoy the journey!
