# mNAV To BTC Yield Ratio

Just like PEG ratio for Trad-Fi world, mNAV to BTC yield ratio measure how expensive this bitcoin treasury company is. Just divide mNAV with BTC yield to get the result, lower is better.

```
mNAV To BTC Yield Ratio =  mNAV / BTC Yield
```

## Example

| Stock | mNAV | BTC Yield YTD | YTD Ratio | Forward BTC Yield | Forward Ratio |
| ----- | ---- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| MSTR  | 1.84 | 0.168         | 10.95     | 0.25              | 7.36          |
| MTPLF | 5    | 2.25          | 2.22      | 3.32              | 1.51          |

# Vitality Index

Saylor has told the world, "Volatility is vitality ". With higher volatility, bitcoin treasury company could raise more capital with convertible debts. But volatility is not only vitality source, the daily turnover of stock is also important.

I invent vitality index to measure the stock vitality.

```
Vitality Index = HV(30D) + Daily Turnover * 1000
```

## Example

| Stock      | HV %    | Trunover % | Index   |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| MSTR       | 61.39   | 8.47       | 146.09  |
| MetaPlanet | 157.34  | 11.83      | 275.64  |
| SMLR       | 112.81  | 12.28      | 235.61  |
| HIMS       | 134.272 | 12.56      | 259.872 |
| TSLA       | 63.6    | 3.19       | 95.5    |
| PLTR       | 64      | 4.3        | 107     |

# Current stock pick

Of course you should invest into MSTR, cause it's the first and largest bitcoin treasury company in the world.But what else can we choose?According to two custom metrics I introduced above, I think MetaPlanet is a good choice.
